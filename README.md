[b][Basic Info][/b] RedTech is a mod designed for people who want to enjoy the advantages of tech mods such as IC2, without the confusion and hassle they offer!

[b][Making][/b] RedTech was made entirely by LennyLen along with all the textures!

[b][Usage] [/b]RedTech is a very simple and initiative mod! In its current state it adds only one item, however it's planned for many more things to be added! Most of the items in this mod are powered on Redstone!

[b][Refinery][/b] This machine gives you the advantages of the macerator and pulveriser combined, without the hassle of engines and dusts! Simple put an ore in the upper slot, and fill the slot on the far left with Redstone! It's as simple as that! One stack of Redstone will power one stack of ore.
